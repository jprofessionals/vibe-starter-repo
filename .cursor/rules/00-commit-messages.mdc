globs:
  - "**/*"

When generating commit messages:

- Use Conventional Commits: `<type>(optional scope): <description>`
- Allowed types: feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, perf, test, build, ci, chore, revert.
- Keep header â‰¤ 72 chars; use body to explain why; add BREAKING CHANGE: footer when needed.
- Prefer present tense, active voice.

If changes are broad, structure the body with bullets and affected modules.
