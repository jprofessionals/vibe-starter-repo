# Junie Guidelines

Example guidelines for Junie.

Copy the content of the guidelines file you want to use as basis for your own guidelines into the `${project.root}/.junie/guidelines.md` file, and tweak it to your needs.

You can also make Junie generate the guidelines file for you, by asking it to do so, which is *very* useful if you already have a project and want to start using Junie.
